          Travel time to the nearest starbase? Wouldn't that bring about chaos? A lot of things can change in twelve years, Admiral. I guess it's better to be lucky than good. We know you're dealing in stolen ore. But I wanna talk about the assassination attempt on Lieutenant Worf. In all trust, there is the possibility for betrayal. Yes, absolutely, I do indeed concur, wholeheartedly! When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? and attack the Romulans. Fate protects fools, little children and ships named Enterprise. Did you come here for something in particular or just general Riker-bashing? Why don't we just give everybody a promotion and call it a night - 'Commander'? The look in your eyes, I recognize it. You used to have it for me. Mr. Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship. Fate. It protects fools, little children, and ships named "Enterprise." What's a knock-out like you doing in a computer-generated gin joint like this? This should be interesting. Captain, why are we out here chasing comets? They were just sucked into space. Sorry, Data. The unexpected is our normal routine. The Enterprise computer system is controlled by three primary main processor cores, cross-linked with a redundant melacortz ramistat, fourteen kiloquad interface modules. Your shields were failing, sir. What? We're not at all alike! I recommend you don't fire until you're within 40,000 kilometers. Well, that's certainly good to know. We finished our first sensor sweep of the neutral zone. Maybe we better talk out here; the observation lounge has turned into a swamp. I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. We have a saboteur aboard. Yesterday I did not know how to eat gagh. I've had twelve years to think about it. And if I had it to do over again, I would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at you instead of them. Our neural pathways have become accustomed to your sensory input patterns. Is it my imagination, or have tempers become a little frayed on the ship lately? Besides, you look good in a dress. Worf, It's better than music. It's jazz. I'm afraid I still don't understand, sir. Commander William Riker of the Starship Enterprise. Computer, belay that order. Ensign Babyface! Now, how the hell do we defeat an enemy that knows us better than we know ourselves? Computer, lights up! Well, I'll say this for him - he's sure of himself. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Your head is not an artifact! How long can two people talk about nothing?
